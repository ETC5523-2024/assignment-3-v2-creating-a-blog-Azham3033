    "text": "Analysis\n\nCoffee Consumption by Age and Gender\n\nAs Figure 1 illustrates, the most significant coffee-drinking group among males is the 25-34 age bracket, with 1,284 coffee consumers. Females show peak consumption in the 35-44 age group, totaling 419 consumers. This difference highlights the importance of targeted marketing for different demographic segments as described in the Problem descritpion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Coffee Consumers by Age and Gender\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder consumers, especially those aged 55 and above, make up a smaller portion of the overall coffee consumer base. However, their preference for traditional coffee types like regular drip coffee suggests that this demographic remains a valuable market, particularly for classic coffee offerings.\n\n\n\nCoffee Preferences by Gender\n\n\n\nCoffee Preferences by Gender \n\n\nCoffee Type\nMale Count\nFemale Count\n\n\n\n\nPourover\n829\n112\n\n\nLatte\n301\n271\n\n\nRegular drip coffee\n277\n90\n\n\nEspresso\n258\n22\n\n\nCortado\n218\n45\n\n\nCappuccino\n191\n89\n\n\nAmericano\n160\n60\n\n\nIced coffee\n83\n48\n\n\nOther\n69\n23\n\n\nMocha\n61\n41\n\n\nCold brew\n57\n32\n\n\nBlended drink\n20\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular drip coffee is the preferred choice for both males and females, as shown in @gen_count. For males, 829 prefer regular drip coffee, while 277 females prefer it. Younger males, especially those between 25-44, tend to favor specialty coffees like Espresso (258) and Latte (301). This insight suggests an opportunity for coffee companies to promote these coffee types specifically to younger male consumers.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis analysis provides valuable insights into coffee consumption trends, offering guidance for crafting more effective marketing strategies. Males aged 25-34, identified as the largest coffee-consuming group, show a strong preference for specialty beverages like lattes and espressos. Meanwhile, older consumers maintain a preference for regular drip coffee, indicating a solid market for classic coffee products.\nBy aligning product offerings and marketing campaigns with these demographic trends, coffee companies can improve customer engagement and foster brand loyalty, directly addressing the challenges outlined in the Problem descritpion."
